# lochy
A LOC (Lines of code) / SLOC (Source lines of code) / LLOC (Logical lines of code) counter.

## Introduction
This project basically counts the lines of code in a file / directory / project and displays some information about it such as:
- LOC (Lines of code)
- SLOC (Source lines of code)
- LLOC (Logical lines of code)
- Number of comment lines
- Number of blank lines
- Number of loops
- Number of if statements

## But wait what is SLOC and LLOC!?
### SSLOC
SLOC is simply the number of lines of code if all blank lines and comments are removed.
### LLOC
LLOC is a bit more complex... I will leave a [link](https://blog.ndepend.com/how-measure-lines-code-lets-count-ways/#:~:text=Source%20lines%20of%20code%E2%80%94the,as%20more%20than%20one%20statement) for now and update this later to explain it myself.
